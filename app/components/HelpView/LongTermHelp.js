    		<h2>Long Term Goals Help</h2>
        <h3>“Don’t give up what you want most for what you want now.”</h3>
        <p>Spend some time thinking about your 3, 5 and 10 year goals first as these should determine your 1 year goals. This format breaks up your personal, professional, family and community goals to ensure balance. There is also a box that copies your Core Purpose and Core Values. Ideally, each goal will align in some way to your purpose and to one or more of your Core Values.</p>
        <p>Having alignment with each of your goals over the long-term is critical. With this format, you can map the progressions you will need to make in each category towards your 10 year goals.</p>
        <p>Many of us are good at making and hitting one year goals. However, those goals aren’t necessarily aligned with where we said we wanted to go. As an example, if I want a beach house in 10 years, then I need to be setting tangible goals each year that will put me on a path to purchase that beach house; it won’t just appear in year 10. So that might be creating saving goals and a plan to reach them, finding a realtor, visiting communities, etc. Reaching this goal may require that you give it priority over other short term objectives. For instance, getting the beach house may mean skipping a fancy vacation this year in order to save.</p>
        <p>All your goals should be S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Timely) so that it is very clear if it has been achieved.</p>
        <p>
          Here is an example of the same goal. One written in the SMART format and one not:
          <ul>
            <li>“I want to run a long-distance marathon”</li>
            <li>“I am going to run a half marathon in Las Vegas by June 2017”</li>
          </ul>
          With the first wording, you won’t really know if you hit your goal or what steps you need to take to get there. With the second one, the objective is very clear as is the timeline.
        </p>
