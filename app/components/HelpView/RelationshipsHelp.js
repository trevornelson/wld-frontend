        <h3>“Success is what you know, raised to the who you know.”</h3>
        <p>A Relationship Dashboard is where I have seen the most impact from the Law of Attraction. Keeping the names of those who matter most in our lives and to our success front and center is a huge asset. Seeing these names each day will trigger ideas, opportunities and serve as a reminder. I would encourage you to think about what you can do for these people rather than what they can do for you. The goal is to have 30-40 Key Relationships organized by priority or importance. These will be reshuffled on a regular basis.</p>
        <p>I keep a few different columns on my Relationship Dashboard. Experiment with what works best for you and you can use this more of business or for personal or both. Here are a few Relationship column examples you can choose from:
          <ul>
            <li>Current Companies: These are the company realtionships that are most important to my business.</li>
            <li>Current People: These are the names of the individuals who are the most important to my business and who can help us succeed. They may be related to the company list.</li>
            <li>Emerging People: People I am starting to develop a relationship with that I expect to become important to my business.</li>
            <li>Aspiring People – Business or Personal: These are the people who I don’t know yet but who I aspire to meet and engage with. I encourage you to go big with this list. One of the fascinating things you’ll discover by listing these names is how connections to many of them will start to appear in your network.</li>
            <li>Want to Work (WTW): This is a list of people in my life who I want to find a way to work with in business in some capacity. I may have worked with them in the past, know them personally, etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
    	</div>
