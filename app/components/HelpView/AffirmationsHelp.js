    		<h2>Affirmations Help</h2>
        <p>Much has been written about the power of positive affirmations. It takes some getting used to, but it’s a practice that is the hallmark
          of successful people, including Tony Robbins, Oprah Winfrey and Will Smith.</p>
        <p>List out a sentence that corresponds with each of your visualization images. The sentence should describe the future state of your goal.</p>
        <p>Again, make them S.M.A.R.T. goals and give a due-date to each one. It is also suggested that you outline what you will give in return for
           this outcome as it takes something to get something. It’s essential to know what you are willing to give up or do in order to receive.</p>
        <p>
          <span>Examples:</span>
          <ul>
          <li>I will complete an Olympic Triathlon in 2017 (and I will practice each week…..)</li>
          <li>I will be a VP at my company by 2020 (I will become an invaluable resource and work to create the best outcomes for me peers and clients)</li>
          <li>I will fly a plane by 2025 (I will make the time and study harder than anyone…)</li>
          <li>I will have a $5M business by 2020 (I will do this by offering the best and most innovate products on the market)</li>
          <li>I will have $1M in savings by 2020 (I will do this by being the best employee I can and be and with discipline in my spending)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Visualizations</h3>
        <p>Seeing your goals visually each day is a very powerful exercise that will set your mind in the right framework,
           simply put this will be your digital vision board. It coincides with the Law of Attraction. On Thanksgiving, when
           Jim Carey was a broke, 28-year-old comic, he wrote himself a check for $10 million dated five years out and carried
           it in his wallet each day. Five years later he was paid $10 million for his role in Dumb and Dumber –right before Thanksgiving.
           Try to find an image of each long-term goal as well as a few short ones so you have a good balance.
